# Jupyter Notebook Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Hotel Booking

## Author: Sumukha Nidhi B S

This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data. It aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can guide business decisions and improve understanding of customer behaviors. The notebook walks users through data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization in a systematic and interactive manner.

## Notebook Overview

### Key Sections:

#### 1. Introduction:
- Provides an overview of the dataset, its source, and the objectives of the analysis.
- Explains the importance of analyzing hotel booking data to identify key metrics like customer origins, pricing trends, and cancellation patterns.

#### 2. Data Understanding:
- Loads the dataset and gives a detailed description of its structure.
- Explores key features such as booking dates, customer demographics, and room types.
- Highlights initial observations and potential data quality issues.

#### 3. Data Preparation:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Addresses null values in the dataset, providing justifications for imputation or removal.
- **Cleaning Invalid Entries**: Removes rows with zero guests or logically inconsistent values to ensure data integrity.

#### 4. Analysis and Visualizations:

- **Guest Origins**:
  - Uses geographic data to identify where the majority of guests are coming from.
  - Visualizes the distribution of guest origins using plots and maps.

- **Room Price Variation**:
  - Examines how room prices fluctuate throughout the year.
  - Plots seasonal trends and identifies peak pricing periods.

- **Stay Duration**:
  - Analyzes the average length of stay for guests.
  - Differentiates between valid and invalid bookings, focusing on non-cancelled reservations.

- **Marketing Segments**:
  - Categorizes bookings by marketing channels to determine the most effective sources.
  - Compares segment performance in terms of revenue and booking volume.

- **Booking Cancellations**:
  - Identifies the months with the highest cancellation rates.
  - Explores factors contributing to cancellations, such as lead time and room availability.

### Summary of Notebook Contents:
- **Total Cells**: 103
  - **Markdown Cells**: 17 (descriptive content, headings, and explanations)
  - **Code Cells**: 86 (data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualizations)

### Example Insights:
- The majority of bookings come from specific countries, highlighting potential target markets.
- Room prices are highest during holiday seasons, with significant variation across months.
- Guests tend to stay longer in resort hotels compared to city hotels.
- Cancellation rates are particularly high in certain months, necessitating better customer retention strategies.
